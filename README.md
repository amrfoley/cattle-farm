David owns a cattle farm and is managing hundreds of cattle. And now he is looking for a system that can help him manage the cattle. And when he reaches out to a software development company, you, as a backend developer, are assigned to this project for its backend and database.

Base on Davidâ€™s requirements, this project should have 4 pastures, 100 bulls, and 100 cows. It should also allow David to record the condition of grass in each pasture, assign a certain number of bulls or cows to each pasture, record the pasture the cattle is in each day, record the health condition and weight of each cattle, set price for each cattle and sell/buy cattle for the farm.
